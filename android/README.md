This app is implemented with the [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) like in
[this tutorial](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/how-to-build-custom-android-app-for-your-arduino-project-using-mit-app-inventor/).

* [APK to install on your phone](aepl_duino.apk)

> **NOTES**:
>
> * If your Bluetooth device doesn't show up in the list when pressing `Connect`, make sure you have
>   paired it first. Default settings:
